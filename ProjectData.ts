    description: `Ever heard of the International Leadership Training Program (ILTP)? Well, I built their website using ReactJS! It's this cool volunteer organization based in the US.

A snazzy website that showcases my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and commitment to creating awesome user experiences.`,

Regrettably, I encountered a challenging situation where I invested significant time and effort, nearly a month, building the website. The client consistently requested revisions, leading to increasing complexity in the project. Ultimately, I made the difficult decision to discontinue the project, but I emerged from this experience having gained invaluable lessons.',
